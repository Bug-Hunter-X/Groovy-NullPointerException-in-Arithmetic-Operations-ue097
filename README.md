# Groovy NullPointerException Example

This repository demonstrates a common error in Groovy related to null pointer exceptions during arithmetic operations.  Groovy's flexible typing can mask potential null issues until runtime.

The `bug.groovy` file contains a function that performs addition, but it has a simple null check that could be improved. The `bugSolution.groovy` demonstrates best practice in handling potential null values.
